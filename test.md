# Board Games
## A hobby that cost a fortune

My favorite board games:
* Betrayal at House on the Hill
* Terra Mystica
* Shadow Hunters

'''puts "I love board games, but they cost a lot."'''

The **biggest** issue with board games is not the cost, but finding good games for more than 5 players.

A great resource for board games is [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/).
